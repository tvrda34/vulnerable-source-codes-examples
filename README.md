# Vulnerable Code Snippets Collection

I used this repository for my master thesis vulnerable code collection. I am not the author of any of these snippets and I have just collected them into this repository to make my life easier.

This repository contains a collection of intentionally vulnerable code snippets designed for:

- **Security Education**: Understand common coding pitfalls and vulnerabilities.
- **SAST Tool Testing**: Evaluate the effectiveness of Static Application Security Testing tools.
- **Code Review Practice**: Improve your skills in identifying and mitigating security issues.

**⚠️ Disclaimer**: These code snippets are intentionally insecure and should only be used in controlled environments for educational purposes. Do not deploy them in production systems.
